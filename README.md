## Available Scripts

This will run the server part of the project. The express server will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)<br/>

To be able to run both client and server, you must go within the client directory and also run

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br/>

**Both must be running simultaneously to fetch any data.**
